This assignment is a calculator for the final price of a cart of items including the tax based on the state that they are in. The taxation.py file has one function that 
takes in the state as its 2 capital letter abreviation and a dictionary that has the item type name and price for each item. This function takes into consideration the 
different tax rates based on the state as well as what items taxes are exempt from. The tests can be found in the tests folder inthe file tests.py and are automated 
using a github actions workflow.
